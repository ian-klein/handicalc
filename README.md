*Handicalc* is a simple application for calculating golf playing handicaps at different courses in the UK and for different games formats.
The golf course database was constructed using golfcourseapi.com and seems to have similar data to the databaase at the USGA. It has many innaccuracies, so
the app allows you to edit the course information, and create new courses with a few simple taps.

The app is designed to run on a mobile phone.
